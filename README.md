## Synopsis

The Green Gleaner was created over a 2-week period for my front-end capstone project at the Nashville Software School. It is a web application that allows growers a way to post listings notifying the public of cosmetically-inferior produce they have available for sale or harvesting. The app allows farmers to post Boxes or Harvest Opportunities. Listings describe the content, quality, pick-up location, etc. of the boxed produce and harvest opportunities. The Gleaner Guild allows anyone to sign up to receive notifications via text of the the most current harvest opportunities. Farmers are encouraged to rate Gleaner Guild participants to limit the number of yahoos trying to come to their farms. As of 4/5/17 there is no payment processing integrated in the application, but farmers have access to a rudimentary inventory tracking system under "Your Account".
